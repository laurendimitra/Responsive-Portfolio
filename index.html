                    <p id="bio"><br>Lauren is working to become a full-stack developer and has been a junior front-end developer/content
                        manager for two years. While Lauren feels strongly and passionately for digital engineering and development,
                        this was not always the case. Her first love was International Diplomacy and followed closely by
                        Investigatory Journalism. After a few internships in college she quickly realized she more in love
                        with the idea of these careers than the actuality of bureaucracy and monopoly owned bias.
                        <br><br>She first discovered the world of web-design during her departmental honors project in Communications,
                        where Lauren ambitiously decided to build a website and social media platform to raise awareness
                        of human trafficking in America. While she knew nothing of web-design or development, WordPress became
                        her best friend. Post-graduation she took an offer with AmeriCorps at a crisis center for victims
                        of Domestic and Sexual Violence, where she worked again with Wordpress on developing the center’s
                        website.
                        <br><br>Post-service she knew she needed to be in the world of digital marketing and thus applied
                        for a management position she was severely under qualified for. That gutsiness as well as her proven
                        track record of learning quickly and tenaciously, landed her a position as a junior web developer
                        and content manager. After almost two years of working in that position, as well as moonlighting
                        on numerous sites, she feels that she has reached the limit of enjoyment gained from managing the
                        content on sites and is eager to learn more and dive deeper in the stack! Her ideal outcome would
                        be to find a career that helps her balance her thirst for knowledge and love of troubleshooting with
                        an impactful organization that shares her desire to leave the world better than she found it.
                        <br><br>Described by her friends and colleagues as a hard worker, a bit of a weirdo, and a high-functioning
                        punk/hippy hybrid, Lauren is an avid coffee drinker and wine enthusiast. In her spare time Lauren
                        likes to play sports, pick things up and put them down at the gym, and do fun things outside. She
                        is also very into painting, singing, and spending time with her friends. Though, she doesn’t have
                        a ton of free time, because she’s working hard to provide a better life for her cat Tiger Lilly.
